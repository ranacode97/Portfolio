📉 Australian Health Data Visualisation & Analysis using Tableau

[🔗 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ranacode97/Australian-Health-Data-Visualizations)

Overview:
This project uses Tableau Public to conduct a visual analysis of hospitalisation, emergency department (ED) presentations, and preventable hospitalisations across Australian states and cohorts over five financial years.

Key Highlights:
	•	Developed dual-axis line charts, choropleth maps, stacked area charts, and pie-on-map visuals to explore multidimensional health data.
	•	Applied data cleaning and imputation in Python (Pandas, NumPy) to handle incomplete entries (e.g., “n.p.”) for accurate analytics.
	•	Identified key trends like the rise in police-arranged ED visits post-2019 and the burden of preventable conditions such as UTIs and dental issues.

Skills Demonstrated:
	•	Data preprocessing and imputation
	•	Interactive visualisation with Tableau Public
	•	Geographic and temporal data storytelling
	•	Analytical insight generation using health metrics

Sample Visualisations:
	•	📈 Dual-Axis Chart (Hospitalisation vs ED over time)
	•	🗺️ Choropleth Map (Hospitalisation Rate by State)
	•	🧩 Matrix Chart (Preventable Conditions by State)
	•	📉 Stacked Area Chart (Top PPH Trends over 5 Years)

Tools Used:
Python, Tableau Public, Microsoft Excel
